# Atomic locking for the collector supervision kernel.
#
# Two locks, both plain directories:
#
#   collector.lock        held for the whole life of the collector. Its
#                         presence plus a matching process identity is what
#                         makes "exactly one collector per data root" true.
#   collector-start.lock  held only across a start attempt, so two supervisors
#                         racing to start a missing collector do not both fork
#                         one.
#
# A claim is made in two stages, and there is no check-then-write
# (`[ -e ] && echo >`) anywhere — that pattern has a race wide enough to drive a
# truck through.
#
#   1. `mkdir` creates the lock directory. mkdir(2) either creates or fails with
#      EEXIST, with no window in between, and stays atomic over NFS and most
#      other shared filesystems.
#   2. The owner is then claimed by creating `pid` under `set -C` (noclobber),
#      which makes bash itself open the file with O_CREAT|O_EXCL. Exactly one
#      process can win that, and the winner's PID is what the file holds.
#
# Stage 2 is not belt-and-braces. `mkdir` here is whatever `/usr/bin/mkdir` the
# host ships, and that is not always a correct one: Ubuntu 25.10's uutils
# coreutils 0.8.0 `mkdir` reports SUCCESS to several concurrent creators of the
# same directory (the same race under perl's mkdir(2), or under stage 2, has
# exactly one winner). A supervision kernel whose singleton guarantee depends on
# the host's `mkdir` binary being race-correct is not a guarantee. Stage 2 runs
# inside bash, so correctness does not depend on any external binary.
#
# A lock is ABANDONED only when its recorded process is provably gone: no
# usable PID, a dead PID, or a live PID whose identity no longer matches what
# was recorded. Age is never evidence. A healthy collector that has been up for
# a week holds a week-old lock, and reclaiming it because it "looks stale"
# would kill the very thing the lock protects.
